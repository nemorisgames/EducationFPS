----

For whatever reason, upon import, Unity removes any animation called "run" from all of the RFPS animators which causes a chain reaction and basically causes the whole game to fall apart. 
You'll need to manually replace these upon import.

RFPS changes the default timescale to 0. Make it 1 or add an RFPS player to the scene to make it work.
